# flog

Generates a static website from an org-mode file. Tags and properties become filters you can sort and order by. A filtering-happy blog. A flog.

```
python flog.py path/to/orgfile.org
```

Everything in /resources will be copied, along with the generated HTML, to /output. Look at demo.org for an example site.
