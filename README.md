# flog

Generates a static website from an org-mode file. Tags and properties become filters you can sort and order by. A filtering-happy blog. A flog.

```
python path/to/flog.py orgfile.org 
```

Everything in flog/resources/ will be copied, along with the generated HTML, to output/ in the current directory. Look at demo.org for an example site.
